The codes for xQSM and the background U-nets implemented with MATLAB(2019a or later) and Pytorch(1.1 later).

For quick evaluation of our network, please directly use the scripts and functions provided in "eval" folder. We also provided a simulated human brain COSMOS data in this folder. 

To train your xQSM network, please add the "train" folder into your matlab path.
It is strongly recommended that the training should be performed on GPU.
