For quick evaluation of our network, please directly use the scripts and functions provided in "eval" folder. We also provided a simulated human brain COSMOS data in this folder. Four pretrained networks (xQSM_invivo, U-net_invivo, xQSM_synthetic, U-net_syntheticOB) were also provided.

To train a new xQSM network based on your data, please add the "train" folder into your matlab path, and then run the script files: TrainUnet.m and TrainXQSM.m. It is strongly recommended that the training should be performed on GPU, or on high performance computing clusters.
