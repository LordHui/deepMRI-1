## For quick demo/evaluation of our network
Please directly run the '**run_demo.py**' script provided in '**eval**' folder. We have provided a human brain COSMOS and its local field map (.nii files) in folder "xQSM/matlab/eval". Four pretrained networks (xQSM_invivo, U-net_invivo, xQSM_synthetic, U-net_synthetic) can be directly applied.

## To train a new xQSM network based on your data
To be uploaded shortly.
